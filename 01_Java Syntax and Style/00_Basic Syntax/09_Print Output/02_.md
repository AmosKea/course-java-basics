“System.out.print” prints one line on the console and “System.out.println” prints on the console followed by a new line. The “System” part of the statement accesses all of the methods and classes associated with the “System” class, which is automatically imported. The “out” part of the statement accesses all of the methods and classes related to output. The “print” or “println” is a method contained inside “System.out”. Please notice that the statement which we want to print out on the console must be enclosed by double quotation marks.
