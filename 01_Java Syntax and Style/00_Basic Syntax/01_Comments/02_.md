In the above example, some comments span more than one line. To get the Java compiler to ignore multiple lines, we use at the beginning of the comment and at the end of the numerous lines of comments. When using this method to add a lengthy comment, make sure there are no characters between and . The and can start and stop anywhere on a line. Everything between the pair is a comment ignored by the compiler. `/*``*/``/``*``/*``*/`
