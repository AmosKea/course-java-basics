When a variable’s or method’s access is not specified public or private, it will have default visibility. Default visibility is packaged private; it is visible to all classes in the same package. It is best to declare members public if that is the true intent. If an instance variable is declared private, then it can be used only by the methods of that class. In the preceding example, “AccessControlTest” has its own private variable that is not accessible by the main method of the “AccessControlExample” class.
