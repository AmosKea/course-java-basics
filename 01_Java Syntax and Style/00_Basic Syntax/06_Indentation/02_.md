The goal of indentation is to show the logic of our program. Keeping indentation consistent is essential. For statements inside a left and right brace, increase the indenting by two spaces. When another pair of braces is nested inside those braces, increase the indentation for the statements they contain by another two spaces. It is a good idea to line up the braces vertically. Please remember, the function of code indentation is to make the program more readable and understandable which saves an immense amount of time when we edit and refine the code.
