When we try to run the code above an error occurs and nothing is printed out onto the console. Runtime errors happen after the code is compiled and during the time the program is running the code. Because these errors cause the program to crash they are hard to track down. In these cases using Comments to group off parts of the source code to narrow down the location of the error is a useful approach.
