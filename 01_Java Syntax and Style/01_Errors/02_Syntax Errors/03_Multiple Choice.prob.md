>>Which one of these method headers would cause a syntax error? <<

( ) <code>public void SOME_METHOD()</code> {{Incorrect because not following the standard naming conventions does not result in a syntax error.}}
(x) <code>public int some method()</code> {{Correct because method names cannot be two separate words.}}
( ) <code>public static int ExampleMethod()</code> {{Incorrect because not following the standard naming conventions does not result in a syntax error.}}
( ) <code>public void eXampleMethod()</code> {{Incorrect because not following the standard naming conventions does not result in a syntax error.}}
( ) <code>private void exampleMethod()</code> {{Incorrect because it is a proper example of a method header.}}

||Look closely at the different method names when determining the correct answer. ||
