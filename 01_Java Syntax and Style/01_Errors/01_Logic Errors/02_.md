Here the program prints an unexpected value because on of the signs is incorrect in the code. We are looking for the output of 2 but instead we see 50 because the multiplication sign is used inside of the division sign. This may seem like a small and avoidable error, but could be missed and difficult to find when dealing with thousands of lines of code and receiving an incorrect output.
