Objects refer to a particular instance of a class. In the world of Java, this allows us to create particular instances of classes and store in variables called objects. The syntax for creating most objects is as follows, “ClassName variableName = new ConstructorName(parameters);” As you have seen previously, that the constructor name is the same as the class name. Objects can have parameters inside the parenthesis, depending on the constructor of the other class.
