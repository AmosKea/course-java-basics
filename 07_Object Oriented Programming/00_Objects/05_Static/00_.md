A “static” object is unique, there is only one of them in existence in the program at this time. In other words, a characteristic of a class definition that isn’t shared by all its objects is called “static”. When a program is running if there’s only one instance of something, it is “static”.See below for examples of “static” methods, variables and calling them without the use of an object.
