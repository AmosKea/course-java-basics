>>Which of the following best describe encapsulation? <<

( ) A. Fields and methods can be directly accessed by any class. {{A is incorrect because encapsulation is making data private so that only the original class has direct access.}}
( ) B. Fields and methods can be hidden inside of an object using the Java reserved word <code>public</code>. {{B is incorrect because the Java reserved word <code>private</code> is used when making data private.}}
( ) C. Fields and methods can be directly accessed by any other class as long as the two classes are related. {{C is incorrect because even classes that are related and implement each other cannot access private data of another class.}}
( ) D. Fields and methods can be hidden inside of an object using the Java reserved word <code>hidden</code>. {{D is incorrect because "hidden" is not a Java reserved word.}}
(x) E. Fields and methods can be hidden inside an object so that they cannot be directly altered by other classes. {{E is correct because it clearly shows how the purpose of encapsulation.}}
