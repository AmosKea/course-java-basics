The “EncapsulationTest” class consists of two main members, the “private” variable “exampleVariableOne” and the method “getVariableOne()”. This is a “getter” method, which returns the value of a “private” member of the class. This method ensures “exampleVariableOne” will never be in danger of being changed or manipulated but can still be visible. This is one example of how encapsulation works. It’s a concept that will help you avoid unwanted errors when writing big programs.
