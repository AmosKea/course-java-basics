When we call “Object exampleVariableOne = new TypeCastTest()”, “exampleVariableOne” becomes an instance of both “Object” and “TypeCastTest”. Even though this is allowed in Java, you can’t actually call a method or access a variable from the “TypeCastTest” class because you have to specify which instance you mean when attempting to access any members. The solution is to cast “exampleVariableOne” to a “TypeCastTest” so that the program sees which class you are referring to and accesses the members from the right class.
