Do you remember casting “int” and “double” data types? “Type Casts” are similar for objects. The syntax for type casts is as follows, “(requiredType)(expression/variable)”. Something to know when type casting objects is whether or not the class is a "descendant" of another one- has a parent class. If so, we can create objects that incorporate two different classes. We will look at the concept of inheritance in Java soon. For now keep in mind, every single class is a “descendant” of a class called “Object” that exists in the “java.lang” automatically-imported package, so you can create objects like the one below.
