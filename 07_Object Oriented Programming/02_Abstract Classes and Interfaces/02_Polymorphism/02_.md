We utilized type casts and the idea of polymorphism by creating the object “polymorphismExample” using “Object” and “PolymorphismExample”. We have to cast the object so that the program knows which methods we are calling. Because “PolymorphismExample” is not overriding methods from the “Object” class, casting is needed.
