>>Which of the following statements about abstract classes and interfaces is true? <<

( ) A. An abstract class cannot extend another abstract class. {{A is incorrect because abstract classes are allowed to extend other classes.}}
( ) B. An abstract class cannot implement an interface. {{B is incorrect because an abstract class can implement an interface as long as all the methods in the interface are implemented.}}
( ) C. All subclasses of a class that implements an interface do not automatically implement the interface. {{C is incorrect because all subclasses of a class that implements an interface automatically implement that interface.}}
( ) D. You can't declare variables with the type of an abstract class. {{D is incorrect because you can declare variables of an abstract class type but you cannot create objects from an abstract class.}}
(x) E. If an abstract class has no implemented constructors or methods, it is better to make it an interface. {{E is correct because abstract classes can have actual constructors and implemented methods while an interface does not.}}

||Abstract class can implement an interface or extend another abstract class. ||
