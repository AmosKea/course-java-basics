The Java reserved word “implements” is used instead of “extends”. You are able to implement multiple interfaces at once be separating them with a comma. The class that implements an interface inherits the methods and the instance variables of the interface. However, similar to the abstract classes, the methods have to be declared inside the class with a proper method body. Although implemented, the variables from the interface do not necessarily have to be used in the class. In addition, methods from the interface must be declared “public” and all variables in the interface are “public”, “static”, and “final” by default
