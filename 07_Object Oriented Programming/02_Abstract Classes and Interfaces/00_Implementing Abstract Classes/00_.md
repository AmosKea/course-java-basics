In Java an “Abstract” class is a class that cannot be instanced but is a superclass for several other somehow related subclasses. The abstract class contains abstract and non-abstract methods, variables, and even constructors that the subclass class inherits. Abstract methods can only exist inside an abstract classes and regular classes do not have them. This is how an abstract class can be utilized.
