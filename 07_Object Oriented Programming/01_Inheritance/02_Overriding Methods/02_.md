The method “print()” exists in the subclass and superclass with the same signature as in both, and it is overridden by the subclass. The reason the subclass “OverrideMethodTwo” overrides the method “print()” is because it wants to print the extra “String” "World" on the console. When the statements “OverrideMethodTestOne objectOne = new OverrideMethodTestTwo();” and “objectOne.print()” is called, the program first searches for the method in the class “OverrideMethodTestTwo” before it would look for the “print()” method in the superclass, therefore the subclass wins. If the “print()” method was not overridden in the subclass, only "Java" would be printed to the console.`print()`
