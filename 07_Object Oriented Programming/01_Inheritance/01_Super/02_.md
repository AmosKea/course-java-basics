The word “super” is used to call the constructor but also in statements inside the “print()” method. When you start using inheritance in the future, you will most likely be using “super” more for invoking constructors of the superclass. In the code above “SuperTestTwo” invokes the constructor of its superclass “SuperTestOne” and sets directly from the superclass, so when the “print()” method is called in the “SuperTestTwo” class, it prints 10.`parameterOne`
