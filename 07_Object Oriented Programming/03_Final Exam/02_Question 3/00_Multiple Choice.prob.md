>>When designing a class hierarchy, which of the following should be true of the superclass? <<

(x) A. A superclass should contain fields and methods that are common to all subclasses that inherit from the superclass. {{A is correct because it clearly represents the use of a superclass.}}
( ) B. A superclass should be largest, most complex class from which all the other subclasses are derived. {{B is incorrect because the superclass does not necessary have to be the most complex and large class.}}
( ) C. A superclass should contain fields and methods that are only required for the most complex classes. {{C is incorrect because a superclass should contain fields and methods that are required for all subclasses.}}
( ) D. A superclass should have public fields in order to provide access for the entire class hierarchy. {{D is incorrect because a superclass can have private fields that are also accessible by subclasses.}}
( ) E. A super class should contain the most specific details of the class hierarchy. {{E is incorrect because a superclass is usually very general with as little specificity as possible.}}

||A superclass is usually the most simple class that encompass the fields/methods needed by all subclasses. ||
