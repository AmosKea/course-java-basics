In order to increase our range to 0.0 to 100.0, we have to multiply the whole expression by 101 since the function’s range is only 0.0 to 1.0 Then we use casting to change the “double” to an “int” data type value which truncates the decimal and gives us a whole number. There are different methods within the Random class which many be useful to you for various projects in the future.
