We will go into further detail about the methods of the Math class in a further course, but first let’s explore “Math.PI” which is one of the two fields of the Math class. This field represents the value of pi. A dot is used after typing “Math.” to access the field and the method inside the Math class. The programmer must keep in mind the input and output type of the methods inside the Math class to use them correctly without throwing errors. To avoid syntax errors, the method and field names have to match exactly to what is documented in the Java Math class. Conveniently, you do not have to import the Math class as it is already part of the “java.lang” package.
