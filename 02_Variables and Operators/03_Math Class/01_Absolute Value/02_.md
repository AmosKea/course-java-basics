The absolute value method works the same as it does in an algebra class. The input for this method could be an , , , , or even a value and will return the same data type as it receives. Please keep in mind that none of the outputs are rounded when producing the result of the method. Inputting a positive value would simply return the same value while inputting a negative value would return the negative value without the minus sign.`int``float``long``double``short``byte`
