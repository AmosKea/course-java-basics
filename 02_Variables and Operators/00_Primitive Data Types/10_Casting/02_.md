We just converted the “double” value 15.23 into an integer which left only the whole number and the decimal places to be cut off. There is no rounding, it just ignores the numbers after the decimal point during casting. When you convert an “int” to a “double” a decimal point will be added to match with the structure of double data types, as we see here: “double varOne = (double) 15;” assigns 15.0 to “varOne”.
