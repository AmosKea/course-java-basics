>>Which one of these is a valid double declaration? <<

(x) <code>double varOne = -3.1415;</code> {{correct because the primitive data type <code>double</code> holds real numbers as digits.}}
( ) <code>double varOne = '1234';</code> {{incorrect because the integer value cannot be enclosed with single quotation marks.}}
( ) <code>double varOne = MathPI;</code> {{incorrect because "MathPI" is not the proper way to declare a decimal value.}}
( ) <code>double varOne = "123*1234";</code> {{incorrect because the integer value cannot be enclosed with double quotation marks.}}

||Can single or double quotation marks be used when representing a number? ||
