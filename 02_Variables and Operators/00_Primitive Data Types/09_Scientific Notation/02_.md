In the section on “long” data type, we discussed the difficulty of writing very large numbers; scientific notation solves that problem. It can also be used to represent small numbers with many decimal places. The format or scientific notation in Java is exactly the same as you have learned and used in science and math classes. Remember that an uppercase “E” or lowercase “e” can be used to represent “10 to the power of.” And scientific notation can be printed as output on the console if it passes a certain number, so using “System.out.println(exampleVariableOne);” for example, smaller numbers will still read out “1000” instead of “1E+3”.
