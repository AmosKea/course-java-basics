>>Which one of these is a valid float declaration? <<

( ) A. float varOne = PI; {{A is incorrect because "PI" is not the proper way to declare a decimal value.}}
( ) B. float varOne = 12/0; {{B is incorrect because 12/0 is not a number and will throw an error.}}
(x) C. float varOne = 12; {{C is correct because the primitive data type <code>float</code> holds real numbers as digits.}}
( ) D. float varOne = "12"; {{D is incorrect because the integer value is enclosed with quotation marks.}}

||Which of the values above are undefined? ||
