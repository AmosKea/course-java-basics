Byte data type takes up about four times less space than an “int” value, but it is not used for calculations and other methods. The byte data type is useful when dealing with raw binary data for compatibility reasons. Similarly to “float”, “int” and the other integer related data types, the default value for “byte” is 0. Byte data type can only hold whole, non-decimal numbers.
