“short” functions similarly to “int” in that it can only hold whole, non-decimal numbers. This data type was commonly used when 16-bit computers were used, but now it is rare as “int” has pretty much taken its place. But, do notice that “short” takes up about half the space of “int” so in a specific case when you are dealing with a large list of whole numbers, you may chose to use “short” to save space. Although, most times we will use “int”.
