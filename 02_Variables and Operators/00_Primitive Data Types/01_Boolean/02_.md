We see above that boolean values don’t neccisarily have to come out “true” if the expressions can evaluate to true or false. For example “7>9” will be false, while “7<9” will be true. Boolean is extremely useful because it allows for particular statements and methods to be executed only in certain situations based on whether the boolean statement is true or false. For this reason it is one of the most important primitive data types.
