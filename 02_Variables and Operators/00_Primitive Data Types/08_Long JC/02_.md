This example takes us through parsing a “long” variable from a “string” because the value is too big to write in the code. We will look more closely at this functionality in future sections. Similarly to what we have seen before with declaration of primitive data types, the addition of an “l” or “L” at the end of the line is used to tell the program the value is “long”.
