The eight primitive data types, “byte”, “short”, “int”, “float”, “double”, “char” and “boolean” will be covered more in depth in future courses. First, let’s start by exploring what a data type is. Data type enables us to tell the program what kind of data we are trying to represent and use. Always keep in mind that primitive data type names are extremely case sensitive. “Int” is not the same as “int”. The primitive, or fundamental, data types can function as building blocks. There are also larger, non-primitive data types that are made up of smaller components. But let’s begin by learning the primitive eight.
