>>Consider the following statement:
<code>System.out.println(404 / 10 * 10 + 1);</code>
What is printed as a result of executing this statement? <<

( ) 4 {{incorrect because 401 will be printed. Look at the process shown below.}}
( ) 5 {{incorrect because 401 will be printed. Look at the process shown below.}}
( ) 41 {{incorrect because 401 will be printed. Look at the process shown below.}}
(x) 401 {{correct because 401 will be printed after the expression is evaluated through standard order of operations.
The process is shown below:
Expression: 404 / 10 * 10 + 1
          = 40 * 10 + 1  (results in 40 because the division occurs between two integers.)
          = 400 + 1
          = 401}}
( ) 405 {{incorrect because 401 will be printed. Look at the process shown above.}}

||What happens when you divide two integers that donâ€™t divide perfectly? ||
