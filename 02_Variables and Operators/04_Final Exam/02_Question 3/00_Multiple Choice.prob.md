(x) 401 {{Correct because 401 will be printed after the expression is evaluated through standard order of operations.
The process is shown below:
Expression: 404 / 10 * 10 + 1
          = 40 * 10 + 1  (results in 40 because the division occurs between two integers.)
          = 400 + 1
          = 401}}
