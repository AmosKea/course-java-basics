There are two ways to use the increment operator; prefix and postfix increment. The prefix increment looks like “++variablename;” while the postfix increment looks like “variablename++;”. Both of these operations add one to the value in the variable. The difference between the two is in the order it adds. If we use ++ operator as prefix like: “++varOne;” the value of varOne is incremented by one, then the value of is returned. If we use ++ operator as postfix like: “varOne++;” the original value of varOne is returned, then varOne is incremented by one, meaning the original value of “varOne” is printed, and it increases by one after the print statement. It is essential to know the difference between the two types of incrementing even though we will not usually print these values. Incrementing is used heavily in loops, which we will examine in one of the following sections.`varOne`
