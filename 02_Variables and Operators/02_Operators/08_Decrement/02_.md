Like to the increment operator, there are two different ways to use the decrement operator called prefix and postfix decrement. The prefix decrement looks like variablename--;\`. Both of these subtract one to the value in the variable. “--varOne;” decreases the value of varOne by one, then returns the value of “varOne”. “varOne--;” the original value of varOne is returned, then varOne is decremented by one. It is unlikely that we will print these results, but it is essential to know the difference between the functionality as it is commonly used in loops. Also, these operators will reduce the amount of code the programmer has to write and save coding time.`--variablename;` while the postfix increment looks like`
