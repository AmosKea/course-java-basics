>>Which of the following is a valid identifier for a constant variable? <<

( ) A. <code>public final int constantVar = 10;</code> {{A is incorrect because this is the standard way to declare other variables.}}
( ) B. <code>public final int CONSTANTVAR = 30;</code> {{B is incorrect because it is lacking an underscore.}}
( ) C. <code>public final boolean constantvar = true;</code> {{C is incorrect because the characters are not capitalized and separated with an underscore.}}
(x) D. <code>double final CONSTANT_VAR = 2.3213;</code> {{D is correct because identifiers for constant variables have to be in upper case with words separated with underscore.}}
( ) E. <code>public final char Constantvar = 'r';</code> {{E is incorrect because "var" is not capitalized and separated from "Constant" with an underscore.}}
