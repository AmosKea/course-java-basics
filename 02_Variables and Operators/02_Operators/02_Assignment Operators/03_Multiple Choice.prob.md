>>What is the new value of <code>varOne</code> after the following code is executed?
<p><code>int varOne = 12;</code>

( ) 7 {{Incorrect because <code>varOne</code> would equal 12 after the statements are executed. Look at the process shown within the third answer choice below.}}
( ) 19{{Incorrect because <code>varOne</code> would equal 12 after the statements are executed. Look at the process shown within the third answer choice.}}
(x) 12 {{Correct because <code>varOne</code> would equal 12 after the statements are executed. 
The process is shown below:
Line 1: <code>varOne</code> = 12 because it is initialized with the integer 12.
Line 2: <code>varOne</code> = 17 because the statement <code>varOne += 5</code> adds 5 to <code>varOne</code>.
Line 3: <code>varOne</code> = 7 because the statement <code>varOne -= 10</code> subtracts 10 from <code>varOne</code>.
Line 4: <code>varOne</code> = 12 because the statement <code>varOne = 12</code> sets <code>varOne</code> back to 12.}}
( ) -5{{Incorrect because <code>varOne</code> would equal 12 after the statements are executed. Look at the process shown within the third answer choice.}}
( ) An error would occur.{{Incorrect because <code>varOne</code> would equal 12 after the statements are executed. Look at the process shown within the third answer choice.}}

||Look closely at the last statement and think about how it affects the value of <code>varOne</code>. ||
