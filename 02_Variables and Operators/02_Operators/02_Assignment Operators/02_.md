Something to keep in mind when assigning values is the calculation on the right side of the equal sign is completed before assigning the variable on the left with a its new value. As we see in the code above, “exampleVariableOne” and “exampleVariableTwo” are added before being assigned as the new value of variable “exampleVariableOne”. This makes the new value for 60. `exampleVariableOne`
