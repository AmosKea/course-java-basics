Just as we learned in math class, Java honors the order in which mathematical operations should be performed. Division, multiplication, modulus (%), followed by any addition and subtraction. A minor difference between math principles and Java is if we are dividing two integers, the Java answer will also be an integer, not a number with a decimal point, following the same rule of truncation we discussed in an earlier segment. Letâ€™s look at an example: the Java result for 15/2 will be 7.
