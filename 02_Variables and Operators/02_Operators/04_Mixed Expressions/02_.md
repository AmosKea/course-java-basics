Do either of the results surprise you? Take a look at the details. Remember, if any of the operands are a floating point, the whole arithmetic operation becomes floating point. Also, remember parenthesis have the highest precedence in the order of operations and what is inside must be evaluated first. Letâ€™s rearrange the mixed expressions to the correct order of evaluation: (1/3+7.5) / 2.5 = (0+7.5) / 2.5 = (7.5) / 2.5 = 3.0 (exampleVariableOne is a double, so the result is 3.0, not 3) (7/4 + 2/6) + 4 = (1 + 0) + 4 = 5
