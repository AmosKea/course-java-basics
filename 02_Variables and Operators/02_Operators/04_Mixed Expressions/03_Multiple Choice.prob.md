>>What will the value of <code>varOne</code> be after the following expression is evaluated?
<code>double varOne = 8+7*4-2.0/4 + (5-3*4-2)</code> <<

(x) A. 26.5 {{A is correct because the order of operation is followed with consideration to integer/float point division.
The process is shown below:
Expression: 8+7<em>4-2.0/4 + (5-3</em>4-2)
          = 8+7<em>4-2.0/4 + (5-12-2)
          = 8+7</em>4-2.0/4 + (-9)
          = 8+28-2.0/4 + (-9)
          = 8+28-0.5 + (-9)
          = 35.5 + (-9)
          = 26.5}}
( ) B. 64 {{B is incorrect because <code>varOne</code> will be 26.5 after the expression is evaluated. Look at the process shown above.}}
( ) C. 39.5 {{C is incorrect because <code>varOne</code> will be 26.5 after the expression is evaluated. Look at the process shown above.}}
( ) D. -6.8 {{D is incorrect because <code>varOne</code> will be 26.5 after the expression is evaluated. Look at the process shown above.}}
( ) E. 2.5 {{E is incorrect because <code>varOne</code> will be 26.5 after the expression is evaluated. Look at the process shown above.}}
