In the example we see that inside the main method we cannot print “exampleVriableThree” because it exists only as a local variable in the “add()” method. This is where we revisit the concept of access control. The local variable only lives and returns within the method in which it was declared. A local variable is not visible to any other method besides the one in which it exists. If you have a variable that will be used in multiple classes, you must make sure it is outside the method. If you are referencing a local variable outside of the method it exists in, you will get a compile-time error due to access control and visibility.
