"Autoboxing" is a way to work with primitive data types within “ArrayLists” which makes coding easier. If we wanted to create an “ArrayList” of integers, we use “ArrayList<Integer>” because “int” is not an object. However, when we call methods such as “add()” and “set()”, instead of creating a new object like “add(new Integer(11));”, we can just write “add(11)”, therefore autoboxing saves us coding time. Look below for an example of autoboxing.
