>>Which of the following is a logical reason to use an <code>ArrayList</code> instead of an array? <<

( ) A. An <code>ArrayList</code> uses less memory than an array. {{A is incorrect because the amount of memory used is usually greater for an <code>ArrayList</code> than an array.}}
(x) B. An <code>ArrayList</code> resizes itself as necessary when items are added, but an array does not. {{B is correct because an <code>ArrayList</code> is a dynamic array and can freely change in size.}}
( ) C. An <code>ArrayList</code> can store objects while arrays can only store primitive data types. {{C is incorrect because arrays can also store objects. An array of <code>Strings</code> is an example.}}
( ) D. An <code>ArrayList</code> has faster access to the last element than an array. {{D is incorrect because an <code>ArrayList</code> has the same access time as an array to any index.}}
( ) E. An <code>ArrayList</code> can exceed 10 elements while an array cannot. {{E is incorrect because arrays can exceed 10 elements.}}

||<code>ArrayList</code> does not have a set length. ||
