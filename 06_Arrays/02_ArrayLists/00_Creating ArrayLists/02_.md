The syntax for “ArrayList” is a as follows “ArrayList{objectType} name = new ArrayList{objectType}();” By default, an ArrayList will start out with 10 empty cells. If you want to start with an initial capacity, put a number in the parentheses. This does not limit the size the “ArrayList” can expand to. A benefit of an “ArrayList” is that elements may continue to be added no matter what size it was assigned originally. The size of the “ArrayList” will automatically increase and no information will be lost.
