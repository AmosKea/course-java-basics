The syntax for an “enhanced for” statement is as follows, “for(datatype variablename : arrayname)”. The “datatype” and “variablename” is what you would put in the first section of a “for” loop, the loop control variable. This creates a new variable that only exists within the “for-each” loop. It is used as the index when accessing the elements of the array.
