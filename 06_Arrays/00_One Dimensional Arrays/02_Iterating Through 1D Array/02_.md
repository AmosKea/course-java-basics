The “for” statement has the condition “count < exampleVariableOne.length” which makes sure that every element in the array is added to sum before the for loop is terminated. Why do we use “<”? Because the last index of the array is always “array.length - 1” so count cannot be equal to or greater than “exampleVariableOne.length” If we do not specify this, a runtime error may occur.
