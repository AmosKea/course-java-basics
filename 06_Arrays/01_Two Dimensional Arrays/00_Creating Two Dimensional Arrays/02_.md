Like 1D arrays, the index of both indexes start at 0. The first square bracket after the array name specifies the row while the second one dicates the column. If you have “varOne[3][1]” you are indicating the element that exists in the fourth row and the second column. Remember, all indexes start at 0 so “varOne[0][0]” specifies the first row and the first column. Like 1D arrays, all the elements must be the same data type. Initializing is also very similar.
