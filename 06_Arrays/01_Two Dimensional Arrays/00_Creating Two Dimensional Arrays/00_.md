Letâ€™s expand our array conversation to two-dimensional arrays. Spreadsheets, web browser screens, images, and many other types of data are in a 2D format which is why we need arrays that can handle this type of data. A 2D array is laid out in a grid like graph paper, so each element is still housed in its own cell like in a 1D array, but now that element is pointed to by two different indexes and both of these indexes are needed in order to specify that cell. Look at the 2D arrays below.
