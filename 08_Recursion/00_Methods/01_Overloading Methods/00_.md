In Java, the concept of “overloading” is when two or more methods of a class have teh same name but differing “parameter lists.” If this is the case, when a method is called the program matches to the correct method by checking the parameters. To understand this concept further, let’s think back to when we were working in the “Math” class. When we used the methods “abs()”, we were experiencing the concept of overloading as that one method has four different parameter possibilities; the data types ”int”, “double”, “float”, and “long”. Let’s dive into overloading a method.
