>>Which of these Java reserved words is used to explicitly specify the exceptions that a particular method might throw? <<

( ) A. <code>try</code> {{A is incorrect because <code>try</code> is not used to throw exceptions.}}
( ) B. <code>finally</code> {{B is incorrect because the Java reserved word <code>finally</code> is used with the <code>try</code> block for other purposes.}}
( ) C. <code>catch</code> {{C is incorrect because <code>catch</code> is not used to throw exceptions.}}
(x) D. <code>throw</code> {{D is correct because <code>throw</code> can be used like this: <code>public static void calculate() throws ArithmeticException</code> in a method header.}}
( ) E. None of the above {{E is incorrect because <code>throw</code> is used to explicitly specify the exceptions that a particular method might throw.}}

||The answer is straightforward and literally "throws" an exception. ||
