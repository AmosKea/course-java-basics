Although you do not have to directly edit, build, or prepare class files manually in Java, we will still take a look at what the class file is and what it does. In its simplest definition, a class file contains the Java bytecode and has a .class extension. This file is what the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) interprets and converts into machine code. The class file is used by the JVM and not meant for your specific operating system.
