Source code is a text listing of commands, likely with comments, that can be compiled and executed by a machine but written and read by a human. Source code is what allows computer programmers to specify, read, and write the code that governs the actions of a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). As we discussed before, in order for the JVM to run a Java program, the Java compiler compiles the Java source code into Java bytecode which is then interpreted by the Java Virtual Machine and converted into machine language.
