What sets Java apart from other programming languages is the creation of the Java bytecode file by the Java compiler. In other languages, you write the source code then it is converted into a low-level program. The Java compiler takes each class in the source file and separately converts them into Java bytecode files. The file extension for Java bytecodes is “.class” to ensure that no matter what the operating system is, the Java bytecode is readable and run-able on any Java Virtual Machine (JVM), anywhere.
