In addition to the Java compiler, the Java interpreter is another important part of Java programming. The Java Interpreter decodes and executes every statement of bytecode for the Java Virtual Machine and is part of the machine itself. Each platform, for example, a Mac, has its own interpreter that functions to interpret bytecode that works on a Mac, and same for Windows, Linux, and others.
