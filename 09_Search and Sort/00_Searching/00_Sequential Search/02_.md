The sequential search uses a concept we have already mastered, “for” or “while” loops that search for a specified integer in an array. It is named “sequential” since it goes through the elements starting from the first one, indexed “0”, all the way through to the final one. Once the search runs, it returns the index of the targeted value if it is found. This search functionality can be used on any type of array or “ArrayList”, but it may not be your prefered way of searching once you learn about other options in future courses.
