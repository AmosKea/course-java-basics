Again, a binary search will only work if we have a sorted list, but duplicate values don’t affect the search. A “binary” search starts at the middle of a sorted list and assess if the value it’s called to look for is greater than of less than the middle. This initial procedure establishes whether the searched for value is in the first or second half of the list, at which point the search changes its high and low values to focus on the correct half of the list. At that point, the search enters in the middle of its chosen half and does the exact same procedure over and over again until the target value is found or not.
