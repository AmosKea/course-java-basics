In selection sort there are two loops. The inner loop finds the next smallest or largest value and the outer loop places that value into its proper location. Although selection sorts are one of the easier sorts to code, it is also fairly inefficient because there is no way to end the sort early, even if the list is already sorted. No matter what the state of the list is, the selection sort will go through each index, starting with zero, and sort each element through to the end.
