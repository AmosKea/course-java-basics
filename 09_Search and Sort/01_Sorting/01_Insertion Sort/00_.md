“Insertion” sort is a more efficient type of sort as it passes through an array only once and as each element is analyzed, it is put in its correct location at that time. This method is similar to organizing a handful of playing cards where as you pick up each card, you insert it into its correct position in your hand of organized cards. The insertion sort divides the array or “ArrayList” into two sub-arrays; one is always sorted and increases in size as the sort continues, like the organized cards in your hand. The second sub-array is unsorted and contains all the elements yet to be inserted into the first sub-array, like the random cards you are picking up. The second sub-array decreases in size as the sort goes on, while the first sub-array increases in size. Let’s take a look at an insertion sort below.
