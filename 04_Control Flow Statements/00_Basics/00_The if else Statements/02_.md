The “If” statement above tests to see if the ‘boolean’ value of “rain” is true. If it is, the “true branch” statement is executed. If not, the “false branch” statement is executed. Notice we separate the “true branch” and the “false branch” by the reserved word “else”. The expression that goes inside the “if” statement must evaluate to true or false for the statement to execute, and anything that evaluates to a boolean value can be placed inside brackets.
