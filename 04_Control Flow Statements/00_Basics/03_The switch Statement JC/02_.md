The switch statement tests to see whether or not “exampleVariableOne” is between 35 and 40. Each “case” within the switch statement checks to see if “exampleVariableOne” is a certain number, and prints different statements depending on the value “exampleVariableOne” holds. Keep in mind, just one of these cases is selected per execution of the switch statement, and the data type of the expression has to match the datatype of the label. If none of the case labels matches the value of the expression, then the default case is used, and its statements is executed.
