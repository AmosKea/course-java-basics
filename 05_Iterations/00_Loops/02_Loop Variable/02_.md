“counterOne” and “counterTwo” are both loop control variables that say when the loop will terminate and the number of times the loop will execute before it terminates. In both examples above, the loop control value is incremented/decremented by a certain value every time the loop is executed. This is requisite because the loop will run forever if the condition always evaluates true.
