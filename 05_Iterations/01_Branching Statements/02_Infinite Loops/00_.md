We have discussed this in previous sections, but it is essential to make sure each loop you write has a distinct end. For example, if the condition inside the for/while loop is always true, the loop will run forever and will be an infinite loop. It is possible to accidentally create a loop that never ends. Look below to see how the “if” statement prevents the infinite loop from executing over 10 times.
