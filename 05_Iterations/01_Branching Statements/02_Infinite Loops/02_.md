Do you notice that if the “if” statement was not in the code, the “while” loop would run indefinitely? The reason is because the boolean expression inside the parenthesis is always going to return “true”. For this reason, we must make sure that our boolean expressions have an end, meaning they will at some point return as “false” in order to end the loop.
