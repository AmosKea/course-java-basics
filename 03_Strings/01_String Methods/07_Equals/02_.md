First, when using the “==” operator to compare the strings, we recieve a result of “false” because the strings reference two different objects that are held in different memory spaces. But, please keep in mind, if a statement like “String varTwo = varOne;” is called after “String varOne = "Java";” the reference for the variable ‘varTwo’ is the same as the reference of ‘varOne’ so the "==" operator has a result of “true” as long as the first “String” is directly assigned to the value of the second “String”.
