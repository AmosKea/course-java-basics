One of the most useful methods when working with “String” is the “equals” method. In the previous courses we explained how to compare and other data types by using the "==" operator. But contrary to data types, every “String” is an object, which means the "==" operator checks whether or not the reference (not value) for the objects are the same. Because of this distinction, we need the equals method to check to see whether or not they hold the same “String” value. The syntaxt to use is as follows, the syntax for the equals method is “stringname.equals(stringname)”. Take a look below at the difference between the equals method and the "==" operator when working with “String”.`int``String`
