We can assign “exampleVariableOne” to a new “String” object (“Java”) before it prints out. But the old “String” object (“HelloWorld”) still exists because it cannot be changed. The reassignment does not replace the old string for the new one, it only replaces the reference, and both strings still exist but only one is called.
