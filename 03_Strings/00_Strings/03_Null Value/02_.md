In Java, variables created from the class are like containers, they hold a reference to an object. Therefore, creating 10 strings will create 10 objects and 10 different variables that refer to the different objects. If the there exists variables that hold objects, we need a way to describe those variables that are not holding or referencing anything - this is where the null value is important. It tells us that nothing is being held or referenced.`String`
