1. “\” Permits a ‘\’ to be included in the “String”. One “\” is used to escape the string, so the first one escapes the string and the second “\” is added into the string.
2. “\” Using one “\” on each side of characters encloses them in quotations when printing. Since the double-quotations are used to denote a “Sting” in the source code, we need to use something else, the backslashes, to tell the program to print “” in the output.
3. “\n” Makes a new line, so anything in the “String” after the “\n” prints on a new line. In the example above, “Java” is printed on a new line because there is an “\n” directly before it in the code.
