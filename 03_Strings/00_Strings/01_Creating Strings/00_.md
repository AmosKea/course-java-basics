There are two distinct ways to create a “String”; use double-quotation marks or create a new object. Either put text on the same line in double quotation marks as if it was primitive data: “String stringName = "hi";” or initialize them like this: “String stringName = new String("hi");”. Take a look below for examples of initializing a “String”.
