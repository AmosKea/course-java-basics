To create a new object, we use the Java reserved word “new” because “String” is a class within the “java.lang” package. But Java has made it even easier for programmers. As you see above, you can initialize without having to type out “new” saving you on coding-time. Ultimately it is up to you and your own coding style which method of creating a “String” works best for you.
