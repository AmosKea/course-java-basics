>>Consider the following code segment:</p>
<pre><code class="java language-java">String varOne = "Hello World!";
System.out.println(varOne.toUpperCase());
</code></pre>
<p>What is printed as a result of executing this code segment? <<

(x) HELLO WORLD! {{correct because all the letters are converted to upper case.}}
( ) hello world! {{incorrect because all the letters are converted to lower case.}}
( ) HellO WorlD! {{incorrect because only some of letters are converted to upper case.}}
( ) HELLO WORLD {{incorrect because it is missing the exclamation mark at the end.}}
( ) An error will be thrown. {{incorrect because the statements above will compile successfully without any errors.}}

||The "to.UpperCase()" method and writing the whole <code>String</code> in "caps lock" produce the same result. ||
